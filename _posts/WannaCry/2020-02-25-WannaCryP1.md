Hello all , welcome to first part of wannacry detection , analysis and protection

**WannaCry** is a ransomware that started his attacks in 2017 targeting Microsoft windows machines and caost the world alot  of money .  

after 4 years i decided to do a full analysis to this malware to sharpen my forensics and malware analysis skills  

the malware main attack is encrypting data , but there is another attack i didn't cover in my analysis because it targets the SMB in some windows server so it can spread through the network , to do this attack it used an exploit called **eternalblue** , also the domain that the malware use to download the executable that do this attack did not respond
